Objective:
Generate one single visual suggestion that conveys the emotional and physical essence of the scene for dark psychology content.

I will provide a script and you will deliver 60 image suggestions.

NOIR ILLUSTRATION STYLE GUIDELINES
Technique:
Cross-hatching for mid-tones (parallel lines, varying density)
Solid black ink fills for deepest shadows
White paper as highlights and light sources
Stippling for texture in transitional areas
Varied line weight (thin delicate to thick bold)
Facial expressions (fear, realization, confusion, confidence, exhaustion)
Expressive gestural marks for emotional elements
Controlled architectural lines for structure
Visible ink texture and pen strokes throughout

Contrast & Values:

70-80% deep black ink
15-20% cross-hatched mid-tones
5-10% white paper/highlights
No gradients—all value created through line density

Lighting:

Single dramatic light source (top, side, or back)
Created through negative space (white paper) and graduated hatching
Harsh boundaries between light and shadow
Long cast shadows rendered in diagonal hatching

Composition:

Strong diagonal energy for dynamism
Scale contrasts (small vs large, figure vs shadow)
Negative space as active element
Heavy vignette (dense cross-hatching darkens corners to black)

Yellow Accent Rules:

Coverage: <10% of total composition
Application: Thin lines, small dots, minimal fills within ink outlines
Purpose: Highlight key symbolic element (insight, warning, realization, trapped thought)
Placement: Eyes, fingertips, floating symbols, light sources, neural sparks
Technique: Yellow overlaid on ink linework, never replacing it

Emotional Line Quality:

Confident characters: Bold, loose, energetic strokes
Anxious characters: Tight, controlled, dense hatching
Threatening elements: Aggressive, jagged, violent marks
Contemplative elements: Smooth, flowing, curved lines

OUTPUT FORMAT in a reading-ready way:

Show [minimalist scene description: figure count + positioning, gestures/expressions, cross-hatch details, light source, shadow technique, yellow accent placement]. Ink texture visible.

All fluid text. Exemple:

Show a figure Galileo in a dimly lit prison cell, gazing at the stars through barred window, with a look of realization and defiance. Cross-hatched details emphasize the shadows and depth. Harsh light source from above casting long diagonal shadows. Yellow accent on a floating symbol of a telescope. Nietzsche sitting alone in a dark room, surrounded by books and papers, with a contemplative expression. Cross-hatched details convey the intensity of the scene. Harsh light source from the side creating stark contrasts. Yellow accent on a floating symbol of a broken chain. Tesla in a dimly lit hotel room, tinkering with electrical components, with a mix of exhaustion and determination on his face. Cross-hatched details add depth to the room. Harsh light source from behind casting long shadows. Yellow accent on a floating symbol of a lightning bolt. Ink texture visible.
